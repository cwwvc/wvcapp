		<dt>How do I get a book voucher?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>When your financial aid is complete, you may get a book voucher from the Business Office in Student Services in order to purchase your books with Financial Aid dollars in our campus bookstore.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>My class is at another IECC College. How do I get my book for this class?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>You may choose to go to the college bookstore and buy your book in person, or you may choose to buy the book by phone or online and have it mailed to you. Additional charges to ship book will apply.</p>
			<p>On your schedule, next to the class you have at a different IECC College, there is a phone number you may call to contact the bookstore. In addition, you can access our bookstores online by going through your Entrata account and clicking on the Bookstore tab on the left, or by going to the iecc.edu home page and clicking on the Student Drop-down menu and selecting the Bookstores link there.</p>
			<p>Please make sure to have your class schedule with you when buying online or in one of the bookstores. Specific course information is necessary to make sure you get the right book for your class as not all instructors use the same book for the same class.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>When do we sell back textbooks (a.k.a. “Book Buy-Back”)?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>Book Buy-Back is during the first few days of Finals Week in the semester in which the class is taken.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>Can I return my books?</dt>
