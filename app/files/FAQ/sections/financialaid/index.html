				<h2>FINANCIAL AID FAQ</h2>
				<p>Updated #</p>
			</header><!-- Text stuff -->

	<dl>
		<dt>If I donâ€™t get financial aid, can I get other financial support for college?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>Yes! There are opportunities for need-based assistance based in your community and on campus. Please contact Student Services to make an appointment to meet with or speak to the Retention Coordinator if you are concerned you will not be able to afford your classes.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>Will I lose financial aid if I drop a class?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>Dropping and failing courses may affect your eligibility to continue to receive financial aid. However, students are also allowed to appeal to continue to receive financial aid based on the circumstances that kept them from making satisfactory progress in their classes.</p>
			<p>Please contact your Financial Aid Office or your advisor when considering whether you should drop a class. There are often times other options than dropping that can help you keep you on track if things get difficult.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>Why does it say I owe for classes if I filled out FAFSA online on fafsa.gov?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>Filling an application for FAFSA assistance to pay for college is the first step in the financial aid process. Colleges are required to collect additional paperwork verifying information provided by students and their families.</p>
			<p> It is important that you check on Forms to Complete in the Financial Aid area (top right) of your Entrata account to be certain you have completed all the paperwork required to complete your package. Please call Student Services if you need additional help in accessing Entrata or with Financial Aid.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>How often do I need to apply to Financial Aid to get assistance paying for classes each semester?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>Financial Aid is applied for online through fafsa.gov each year. Financial Aid is packaged for the Fall and Spring of the year you plan to attend, with additional aid potential for qualifying students the Summer after Spring semester. Financial Aid follows a Fall-Spring-Summer sequence and students need to renew their application for the Fall term.</p>
			<p>The application process opens in October for the following year. For instance, if you were planning to attend college in the Fall of 2019, you would be able to apply for Financial Aid on fafsa.gov in October of 2018.</p>
			<p>Students may apply for Financial Aid to begin college in the Summer or Spring terms. These students need to apply for aid in the proper year to be considered for aid. Please contact the Financial Aid Office for any questions.</p>
