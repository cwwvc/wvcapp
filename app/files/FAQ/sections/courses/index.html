				<h2>COURSES FAQ</h2>
				<p>Updated #</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>How do I contact my instructor?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>Each course will have a course syllabus with instructor’s contact information. Typically, you will need to contact your instructor via their email account. If you have lost your syllabus or are in an online course, please refer to your access to the course through our learning management system, D2L (Desire2Learn.) Your syllabus will be available on the course home page. </p>
		</dd>
		<dt>When do we register for classes?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>Registration for Summer/Fall Semesters begins in the spring prior, usually by the beginning of April or a little before. Registration for Spring Classes begins by the beginning of November or a little before. As a WVC student, we encourage you to sign up for WVC Group Announcements through your Entrata account under IECC Alerts. You will receive notifications of important deadlines right to your cell. You may also refer to the Calendar in this app to check for those dates in advance.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>Why can’t I register for classes online?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>As a support to our students, we offer person-to-person advisement for our students as a preferred method to make sure that our students are clear about the requirements they need to complete in order to meet their educational goals. Some students are also under special circumstances that may prevent them from adding or dropping courses online as an added protection to the student who may be a part of an athletic program on campus or here under international visas. Additionally, students may be barred from online registration if their are academic or financial holds on their account.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>What should I do if I want to drop a class?</dt>
		<dd><br>
			<p>If you choose to drop a class or multiple classes and are receiving financial assistance, it is vital you talk to our financial aid office or the agency you are receiving assistance from to understand how this will affect the money you expected would pay for college.</p>
			<p>When considering whether or not to drop a class, you must first consider whether or not you are past the refund period for that class. A typical 16 week course has a 10 day refund period. This means that course changes made in the first 10 days of class that goes for 16 weeks will be accounted for in the bill. If you drop a course in the first 10 days, you will not owe for that course if it is a 16 week course. However, any drops made after the refund period will not initiate a refund for the course. Courses that are less than the 16 week period have small refund windows. Contact Student Services for details on those refund periods.</p>
			<p>Another consideration for dropping is whether or not the course is a prerequisite for another course in your program. If you should drop a course you need in order to be prepared to register for the subsequent course in your program, you may extend your time to earn a degree. We recommend that all students considering a drop see their advisor or the Retention Coordinator on campus to help them address any of the previous potential issues. </p>
